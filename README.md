## Who I am 😁
🌁 Born and raised in Berkeley, CA (East Bay Area)  
🧳 Moved one city over to the El Cerrito / Richmond area right before 7th grade and attended high school there    
🐻 Began my college journey at Cal as an undergrad pursuing data science   
💻 Shortly after, I took my first data science / programming course and became really drawn to it     
🧑‍🏫 Worked as a teaching assistant (TA) for [Data 88](https://data-88e.github.io/fa20/), a data science and economics connector course, as well as [Stat 88](http://stat88.org/), a course on probability and mathematical statistics in data science      
🔋 Interned at [Pacific Gas and Electric Company](https://www.pge.com/) (PG&E) as a data engineer 📊 for the [PSPS](https://www.pge.com/en_US/residential/outages/public-safety-power-shuttoff/learn-about-psps.page) wildfire prevention team     
🌐 Currently interning at IBM as a data scientist 📈 for the [Watson AIOps](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/cloud-pak-for-watson-aiops) 🤖 team as part of the [Extreme Blue Technical Leadership Program](https://www.ibm.com/employment/extremeblue/)  
❓ But what's next? I'm currently exploring opportunities that apply agile problem-solving, creativity, and technical skills to resolve difficult and nebulous issues, primarily in the fields of data science, data engineering, and data/product analytics     


## Hobbies of mine
